{"id":"podcast-site-theme-x09","title":"Add hover scale effect to podcast grid images","description":"Add a subtle scale transform on episode card images when hovered. Images should smoothly scale up slightly (e.g. 1.05x or 1.1x) on mouse hover. Create a CSS variable for the transition duration (e.g. --transition-hover: 0.2s or 0.3s) so it can be reused consistently across other hover effects in the theme. Apply smooth easing function for polished feel.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hello@jake101.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T23:42:21.951882-08:00","created_by":"jake","updated_at":"2026-02-15T23:58:40.23124-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T23:58:40.23124-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
{"id":"podcast-site-theme-xi6","title":"Show playing state on episode play buttons","description":"When an episode is playing via the audio player, the Play Episode button on both the episode grid cards and the single episode page should reflect the current state. If the episode is currently playing, the button should change to a Pause button (with pause icon and 'Pause' or 'Playing' label). If the user pauses, it should revert to Play. Requires checking player.currentEpisode.guid against the episode's guid and player.isPlaying state. The single episode page already has this logic but the EpisodeCard does not — it always shows 'Play Episode' regardless of playback state.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hello@jake101.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T15:38:42.726434-08:00","created_by":"jake","updated_at":"2026-02-16T00:05:40.151409-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-16T00:05:40.151409-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
